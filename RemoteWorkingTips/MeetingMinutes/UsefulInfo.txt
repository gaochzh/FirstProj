DatabaseUpgrade:
 - We need to modify vaultcx\Source\CommServer\Db\TblScript\SqlTblScriptsDBU.lst, remove three scripts: simOS, simSystemOS and simOEMMap. The generated tblScriptDBUAll.sql will exclude those three scripts.

Xuemei introduced the password enc/dec tools at \\devshare\devl\pgokhale\CoderTool, pAccess key under “HK_LM/.../Instance01/Database”. We need to first use tool to decrypt it.The plain test consists of “account length”, followed by account and password.

Tips for Linux/Unit client install:
1. Firewall has to be disable, to ensure cvd communicaton (or set correct iptable values):
Next enter the following three commands to disable firewall.
# service iptables save
# service iptables stop
# chkconfig iptables off

If you are using IPv6 firewall, enter:
# service ip6tables save
# service ip6tables stop
# chkconfig ip6tables off

2. Could mount \\eng to local for interactive install/uninstall:
mount eng:// /mnt/eng

3. Useful tools for Linux
- top (with procps installed)
- ldd
- nm
