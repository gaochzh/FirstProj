Source-code (for looking up some logging or error string from the log):

Engineering Portal:

http://engportal/Main.aspx (contains links to logging time-off, devcenter, etc.)

Engineering Tasks website

http://engweb.gp.cv.commvault.com

– The main website for viewing all tasks/defects assigned to developers/testers, etc. This should be a good entry point – as the main page has links to other useful sites.

To see a specific defect #:

http://engweb/qa/mr_details.php?Testdb=no&DebugMode=&DocViewMode=no&Mr=MRHERE

– would replace MRHERE with the defect #.
