Basically here is the step:
1. Sync the CVS to the top of branch. The checkout is not necessary if you already synced using winCVS (it will take a long time)
	cvs login
	cd $CVSROOT
	cvs checkout $PROJECT

2. Initialize git at the top level (not under vaultcx level):
	git init

3. Create a .gitignore file at the top level to ignore project/binary/meta files. See attached .gitignore file

4. Import necessary files/folders to git repository. See attached "GitSyncFiles.txt"
	git add $FOLDERS
	git commit -m "Initial commit"

5. Add a local tag to indicate that git and cvs are synced:
	git tag cvssync

6. Now we can begin our work. First check out a branch for a new form 9999:
	git checkout -b Form9999

7. Do the work on Form9999. Merge it to master once it is done:
	git checkout master
	git merge Form9999

8. Sync the master again to the tip of branch, assuming we already syncec using winCVS:
	git commit -am "Sync with CVS on Jul21"
	git tag -f cvssync

9. Now we could upload the files to either CVS or UpdateCenter for that Form.

10. If others changed related code and we need a merge on branch Form 9999, we could do that (assuming we are on Form9999 branch now):
	git checkout master
	// sync use winCVS
	git commit -am "Pull from CVS"
	git checkout Form9999
	git rebase master
